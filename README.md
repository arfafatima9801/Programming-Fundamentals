# Programming Fundamentals – C++

This repository contains beginner-level C++ programs that I practiced during my Programming Fundamentals course.

## Programs Included

1. **Calculator Program**
   - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   - Handles division by zero
   - Uses switch-case statements
   - Inputs: two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /)

## Note
I used online resources and AI tools for guidance, but I understood and explained the code myself. This project helped me practice basic programming logic and C++ syntax.
